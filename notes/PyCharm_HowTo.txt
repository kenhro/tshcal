How to rename a PyCharm project: First close the project, then change the name of the folder containing the project.
Next, go into the project folder and open the .idea folder, change the filename of the .iml file, then open the .name
file and edit the first line in there, and save.  Now open the directory, and all should be well.

The last part of this goes awry.  No .name file.  Use an editor tool (like Sublime) to find all strings in files within
your project folder and replace old project name string with new.  Close all and reopen folder in PyCharm for that to work.
